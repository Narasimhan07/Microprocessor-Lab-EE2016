## LAB 1 programs

### 8-bit Adder:   
Given two 8-bit numbers in memory, the program must add them and store the sum in a register and carry in another register. If no carry, then the register storing carry must be assigned zero.   
### 16-bit Adder:   
Atmega8 has only 8-bit General purpose registers. So this program must add two 16-bit numbers and store the sum and carry.   
### Multiplier:   
This program multiplies two 8-bit numbers. The simple version of this program just implements multiplication through the MUL instruction available in AVR ISA.   
### Comparing 4 numbers:   
The program must compare the given 4 numbers and store the largest of the 4 numbers in a register as the final answer.
