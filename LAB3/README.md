## LAB 3 programs   
All the programs are implemented using ARM assembly language   
### Computing the factorial of a given number:      
Compute the factorial of a given number using ARM processor through assembly programming       
### Making a 16-bit word:     
Combine the low four bits of each of the four consecutive bytes into one 16-bit halfword.   
For example, if the number is 0x0A0B0C0D then the 16-bit answer is 0xABCD.    
### Finding whether given number is odd or even:         
Given a 32-bit number, identify whether it is an even or odd. (Implementation should not involve division).
