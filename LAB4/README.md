## LAB 4 programs   
All the programs are implemented using ARM C interfacing  
### LED controlling using DIP switch:         
To write a program to dis-assemble a byte into two nibbles from the DIP switch states, multiply and display the product in the LED.            
### Rotating stepper motor:        
To rotate the stepper motor anticlockwise given the code for rotating the stepper motor in clockwise sense.     
### Rotating the stepper motor by 80 degrees only (previous program was indefinite rotation):         
In the previous program, the stepper motor rotated as long as the power supply was intact. In this program we have to rotate the stepper motor by 80 degrees anticlockwise.
