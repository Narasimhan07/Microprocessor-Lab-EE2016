## LAB 2 programs   
All the programs are implemented using AVR assembly and C code.   
### LED blinking using assembly code:      
Using interrupts, blink LED 10 times. 
### LED blinking using C code and INT0:   
The same must be done using C code.    
### LED blinking using C code and INT1:     
The same must be done using C code.
